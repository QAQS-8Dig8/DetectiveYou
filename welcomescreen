#so it turns out that the movie module for pygame was removed from the package a while ago and not replaced.
#so for now, I just added an image instead of a video. My plan is to take the frames from the video
#and add a for loop to loop through them so that it creates an animated effect. For now, here is the new code
# It is working for me to the extent I have coded.
#It should open a fullscreen gui with a background image and window header. The exit square is not working yet though, 
#so you have to kill the code in python to close the window. It does minimize though.

import os
import pygame
from pygame.locals import *

pygame.init()


#create the gui and a title caption in the gui overhead bar 
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((500, 500), HWSURFACE | DOUBLEBUF | RESIZABLE)
pygame.display.set_caption('Detective You')

#This loads the background image. 
#Later we can adjust it for animation of some kind like a gif  or looping through a few images
background = pygame.image.load('welcomescreen_Moment24.jpg')
pygame.display.set_icon(background)

#this makes it open in full screen mode
screen.fill((0,0,0))
screen.blit(pygame.transform.scale(background, (500, 500)), (0, 0))
pygame.display.flip()

#this keeps the background image on the screen and makes the image fill the window

    pygame.event.pump()
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.quit: 
            playing = False
        #elif event.type == pygame.button(): #button still needs implementation so this is commented out for now
        #    stop the welcome loop, stop the music, and go to next screen

            pygame.display.flip()
            
#still need to do:
#write a for loop to loop through images for the welcome loop
#add background music
#add begin button
#enable the exit button
